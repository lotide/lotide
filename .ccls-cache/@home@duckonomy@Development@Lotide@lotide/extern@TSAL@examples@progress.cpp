 * means low pitch, and an almost completed task will be playing at a high
 * pitch. When done in parallel, each thread takes a chunk of the pitch
 * range based on how the omp parallel for pragma divides up the work
 * 
 * Parse the parameters\n
 * Create the mixer and ProgressOctave\n
 * Run parallel block
 * - Update the ProgressOctave
