/** @class MidiParser
 * @brief Parse a midi file for the sake of multithreading playing
 *
 * Midi files are composed of midi events such as note on and note off. The midifile library
 * parses the file and extracts these messages into objects. The goals of TSAL are to
 * audiolize multithreading with sound. One example is processing a midi file. Instead of using different
 * tracks, TSAL overlays sound with multiple threads by reading different portions of a midi file.
 * If a midi file is prepared with this process in mind, one track can contain multiple parts by
 * partitioning equally across the length of the track. To make the use of this concept more felxible,
 * MidiParser ensures that the number of midi events are equally distributed so that this process can
 * be easily performed. It simply adds useless midi events where necessary based upon the number of threads
 * specified
 *
