/** @example rain.cpp
 * 
 * One use of multithreaded is to speed up the processing of data. However, in the case of audio,
 * processing a song at twice the speed doesn't really make sense. As a result, this example was created
 * as the next best thing. To make use of the speed up from multithreading, this example parses
 * MIDI files that store the entire song on one track. When processed with a single ThreadSynth, 
 * the song will play its parts separately. But when processed with the right number of threads. The
 * ThreadSynths will be playing in unison, and the song will be completed properly.
 * 
 * Parse the parameters\n
 * Create the mixer and synths\n
 * Play the song through once with only one thread\n
 * Run parallel block
 * - Calculate a time offset so the later notes get scheduled at the right time
 * - Play the midi events
